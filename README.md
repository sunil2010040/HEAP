# HEAP

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

Operations of Heap Data Structure:

Heapify: a process of creating a heap from an array.
Insertion: process to insert an element in existing heap time complexity O(log N).
Deletion: deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).
Peek: to check or find the most prior element in the heap, (max or min element for max and min heap).
